## 1. SocketCAN  

SocketCAN is a Linux-based socket interface for CAN bus communication. It provides a standardized API for accessing CAN hardware and a set of utilities for working with CAN devices. SocketCAN supports multiple CAN controllers and can handle different types of CAN buses, such as CAN 2.0A and CAN 2.0B.

MeatPi Dual CAN adapter is compatible with SocketCAN, which means it can be used with Linux-based systems that support SocketCAN. This makes it an ideal choice for users who need a high-performance CAN adapter that works seamlessly with their Linux-based systems, and allows them to take advantage of the advanced features and functionalities offered by SocketCAN.

The following commands will bring up 2 CAN interfaces, CAN1 and CAN2.

```
sudo chmod +x rename_serial_dev.sh
sudo ./rename_serial_dev.sh     # This will create /dev/MP-CAN1 and /dev/MP-CAN2
sudo slcand -o -s6 /dev/MP-CAN1 can1; sudo slcand -o -s6 /dev/MP-CAN2 can2   # s6: 500Kbit
sudo ifconfig can1 txqueuelen 1000;sudo ifconfig can2 txqueuelen 1000
sudo ifconfig can1 up; sudo ifconfig can2 up
```

## 2. API

[**API LabView, C#, VB.Net, Delphi, Python - Programming Examples**](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/programming_examples/tree/master/CAN)

## 3. BUSMaster
You need to download the right version of BUSMaster provided in the [**Link**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lIDeNdrtg5cKzxp8Q8V94phF8vOllHDk) above. Here is how to setup the hardware. **Remember to set both Acceptance Code and Mask to '00000000'.**
1. Select VSCom CAN-API by clicking on 'Driver Selection -> VSCom CAN-API"
2. Then Click on 'Channel Configuration -> Advanced' 
3. Click on 'Search for Devices on COM-Ports', the device should appear in the drop downlist or fill the right COM port number
4. Check the 'Hardware Timestamps' check box.
5. Choose the Baudrate.
6. **Most importantly set both Acceptance Code and Mask to '00000000'**.
7. Click 'OK', then Click the Connect button on the top left corner.
